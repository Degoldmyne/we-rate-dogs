# We Rate Dogs Data Wrangling Project

### By Leleji Godwin Lucky

## Dataset
The dataset is one of Udacity's curated datasets made available for the Data Analyst nanodegree progam.

WeRateDogs, whose twitter handle is @dogrates rate dogs that are sent to their Twitter handle with hillarious comments. 
Typically, dogs score above 10 marks out of 10, and that's just fine because 'they are good dogs, brent.'

The dataset consists of about 2,075 dog rates having 12 columns including the tweet_id, dog_breed, etc. for each dog tweet.
In this analysis, I used the Twitter API to retrieve additional information such has the @dogrates comment, tweet_count, etc.

Since the focus of the project is on Data Wrangling, an extensive data wrangling process was carried out on the dataset.

## Summary of findings
It turns out that most dog breeds in the dataset belong to the Retriever family of dog breeds. This points to the fact that one of the most loved dog breeds in the US is
the Retriever family of dog breeds e.g. Golden retriever and Labrador retriever.
A quick trip to Google to confirm our intuition proves to be correct as can be seen in this [link](https://worlddogfinder.com/blog/dog-breeds/most-popular-dog-breeds).
